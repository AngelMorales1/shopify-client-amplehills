This mindset has empowered us to imagine the whimsical flavors that we’re known for! We make all of our ice cream from start to finish. First, we think of a story to inspire a flavor. Next, we find the best ingredients to tell that tale. Then, we pasteurize the milk, cream, sugar and eggs together on-site—we made history as the first to pasteurize on-site in New York City, earning us the nickname of “Brooklyn’s freshest.” (It also means that we are a registered dairy plant.) Because we control every aspect of the process, we have the freedom to add a unique depth to every flavor. To create the salty sweet base for The Munchies, we steep pretzels in the milk before pasteurizing. And even though all of that work is just for one flavor, we think it’s worth it. And we think you will too!',
